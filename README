COPYRIGHT

 (C) Copyright Nick Gammon 2004. Permission to copy, use, modify, sell and
distribute this software is granted provided this copyright notice appears
in all copies.

 You may use it as a starting point for writing your own MUD server.

CREDIT

 I would appreciated being credited in the event that you use this code.

NO WARRANTY

 This software is provided "as is" without express or implied
warranty, and with no claim as to its suitability for any purpose.
 
INSTALLATION

 The simplest way to compile the program is to type "make". This should use the
 enclosed "Makefile" to compile and link. If this doesn't work, to compile without
 using the makefile:

   gcc tinymudserver.cpp -o tinymudserver -g -Wall

EXECUTION

 Run the server like this:

  ./tinymudserver &

CONNECTING

 The default behaviour is to listen for connections on port 4000 (change a constant in 
 the code to alter this). To test the server you could connect to it like this:

  telnet localhost 4000
  
  There is an existing player file supplied, name "Nick" password "password". 
  This player can use the goto, transfer, setflag, clearflag, and shutdown commands.

DESCRIPTION

 This program demonstrates a simple MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) server - in a single file.
